# Safe-return-backend

What will be the backend for safe return. Nothing much to say here just yet.

This is much younger than the frontend, and I have no Go experience, so it's much more barebones for now.
It should make safe return more safe by allowing an alert to be called even if the phone has been broken or has its wifi turned off.
